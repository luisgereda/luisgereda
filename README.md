### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Luis! I come from Peru and currently I live in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

I started a full-stack JavaScript program at Codaisseur in April 2021, where I have learn important frameworks and libraries such as JavaScript, React, Redux, REST API, PostgreSQL, Node.Js, and Express.

Learning these digital skills has broadened my perspective and it has motivated to learn new things. I am looking forward to start working in bigger projects and to collaborate within a developers team.
